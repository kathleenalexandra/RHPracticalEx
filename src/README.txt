exercise 1: 
The style overrides are in the theme.less and variables. less files in the custom folder. The changes for the style changes in the theme are at the bottom of the theme.less file, so that they are compiled after the bootstrap less files. I chose to do this so as to leave the original bootstrap files in tact (given there was an update.)

exercise 2:
There was not a psd for this exercise as was the case for exercise 1, only an image file. I assumed in this was intentional and therefore followed the design comp as closely as possible. You will notice I provided a design for mobile view. 

exercise 3:
I have included my three solutions in a .css file. They are labeled with comments.
